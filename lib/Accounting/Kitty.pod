=head1 NAME

Accounting::Kitty - Simple accounting system for a shared fund

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Accounting::Kitty version {{[ version ]}}.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Accounting::Kitty;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to manage a simple shared fund of money (or
whatever other resource you can count). It main purpose is to track how
much of a total amount belongs to each participant in the fund, allowing
you to perform operations like adding or subtracting from the fund.

The basic working is that of a double entry system: every transaction
always involves two parties. It's possible to handle multiparty
transactions too, but they always resolve to be man two-party
transactions actually. In its current state, it allows to easily track
expenses that should be split across multiple participants, possibly
according to a given preset scheme (e.g. equal split, or weighted, or
based on a table that varies in time).

=head2 Transfer Splitting

A transfer can be split into component parts, e.g. a common expense
might be split across multiple participant accounts.

A split can be either a I<contribution> or a I<distribution>, depending
on how resources are flowing. In a I<contribution>, you're splitting the
original transfer across multiple sources, which will see their
resources decremented (to "participate" in the transfer); in a
I<distribution>, instead, the original transfer is split across multiple
destinations, increasing their resources.

To generate transfers for a split, use L</transfer_contribution_split>
and L</transfer_distribution_split>. They have the same interface,
accepting a hash reference C<\%def> with the following keys:

=over

=item C<date>

the split transaction(s) date (and time), parsed via
L<DateTime::Format::ISO8601/parse_datetime>. Defaults to
the split transfer date;

=item C<description>

a string with the description of the split transaction(s), optional
(defaults to the split transfer description);

=item C<exact>

flag if the C<quota_type> has to be assumed to hold I<exact> values,
i.e. if they have not to be interpreted as I<weights>. Defaults to a
false value, which means that quota elements are usually interpreted as
weights;

=item C<quota_type>

an indication of how to split the input transfer into sub-transfers. See
L</Quotas> for details;

=item C<title>

a string with the title of the split transaction(s), optional (defaults
to the split transfer title);

=item C<transfer>

the transaction to be split.

=back

=head2 Quotas

In L</transfer_contribution_split> and L</transfer_distribution_split>,
there are a few ways in which you can divide a transfer into I<quotas>
(via parameter L</quota_type>), depending on the flexibility level that
you need.

The most flexible way is to pass an array reference containing hashes
with the following fields:

=over

=item C<account>

the account participating in the split with the specific quota;

=item C<amount>

the exact amount for the quota;

=item C<weight>

=back

If the first item contains C<amount>, all of them MUST have the same key
too and an exact split will be performed, using those amounts.
Otherwise, all items MUST contain C<weight>, and these weights will be
used to split the provided amount into splits according to their values.

In addition to this, which requires you to do all the work of either
figuring out the right amounts, or at least determine the weights, there
are also two additional possibilities: using pre-defined fixed quota
weights and using I<finance> splitting weights. These are described
in the following sub-sections.

=head3 Fixed Quota Groups

In fixed quota groups, you refer to a configuration of fixed quotas
inside the database. For example, consider the following case:

   Table: account
   id          name        _type       total     
   ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
   1           External    service     0         
   2           Common      service     0         
   3           Foo         owned       0
   4           Bar         owned       0

   Table: quota
   id          name         account_id  value     
   ----------  -----------  ----------  ----------
   1           fifty-fifty  3           1
   2           fifty-fifty  4           1
   3           100% Foo     3           1
   4           100% Bar     4           1

There are three quota groups, identified by the name: C<fifty-fifty>,
C<100% Foo>, C<100% Bar>. All weights are set to 1, which means that:

=over

=item *

for C<fifty-fifty>, accounts C<3> and C<4> will split equally (as they
have the same weight);

=item *

for C<100% Foo>, account C<3> will take it all (there's no other account
to share the split);

=item *

for C<100% Bar>, account C<4> will take it all (there's no other account
to share the split).

=back

If you are more comfortable you can use percentages, of course:


   Table: quota
   id          name         account_id  value     
   ----------  -----------  ----------  ----------
   1           fifty-fifty  3           50
   2           fifty-fifty  4           50
   3           100% Foo     3           100
   4           100% Bar     4           100

The outcome would be the same (in particular, in the C<fifty-fifty> case
both accounts still have the same weight).

=head1 METHODS

C<Accounting::Kitty> inherits from L<DBIx::Class::Schema>, so it gets
all its methods (most notably the constructor and C<resultset>).

=head2 B<< accounts >>

   my @accounts = $ak->accounts();
   my $accounts = $ak->accounts();
   my @accounts = $ak->accounts(@query);
   my $accounts = $ak->accounts(@query);

retrieve a list of L<Accounting::Kitty::Result::Account> objects.

You can call it either in list context (getting the list of account
objects back) or in scalar context (getting an anonymous array back).

You can optionally pass a C<@query> compatible with
L<DBIx::Class::Schema/resultset>; otherwise, all accounts will be
returned.

=head2 B<< contribution_split >>

   my @transfers = $ak->contribution_split(\%def);
   my $transfers = $ak->contribution_split(\%def);

split a transfer into contribution parts. Returns the list of generated
transfers or a reference to an array with the list, in scalar context.

See L</Transfer Splitting> for details on the parameters in the input
hash.

=head2 B<< distribution_split >>

   my @transfers = $ak->distribution_split(\%def);
   my $transfers = $ak->distribution_split(\%def);

split a transfer into distribution parts. Returns the list of generated
transfers or a reference to an array with the list, in scalar context.

See L</Transfer Splitting> for details on the parameters in the input
hash.

=head2 B<< fetch >>

   my $item = $ak->fetch($what, $query);
   my @items = $ak->fetch($what1, $query1, ...);

fetch multiple items in a I<DWIM> way.

In scalar context, it only gets one single item based on the first two
parameters. In list context, one item is returned for every pair of
input parameters.

Each item is fetched based on two parameters: an item type C<$what> and
a query hint.

The C<$what> can be C<Account>, C<Transfer>, C<Quota> and
C<QuotaFinance>, corresponding to the different result types managed by
this distribution (if you extend it adding more result classes, you can
fetch them too of course).

The C<$query> can be:

=over

=item *

an object, which is passed along unmodified (without checking that it is
of the right class). This allows you to just pass what you have through
C<fetch> and avoid checking;

=item *

a plain scalar, regarded as the item's identifier in the relevant
database table;

=item *

a hash reference containing a query that is compatible with
L<DBIx::Class::Schema/resultset>.

=back

In the following example, we assume that an account exists with id C<1>
and name "Foo". All calls to fetch return the same account:

   my $by_id   = $ak->fetch(Account => 1);
   my $by_obj  = $ak->fetch(Account => $by_id);
   my $by_name = $ak->fetch(Account => {name => 'Foo'});

=head2 B<< initialize_tables >>

   $ak->initialize_tables();

setup initial tables in the database. The schema provided is good for
SQLite, in other DB engines your mileage may vary. Returns nothing.

=head2 B<< multi_transfers_record >>

   my @transfers = $ak->multi_transfer_record(@transfers);

record multiple, possibly related, transfers in a single transaction.
Returns the newly created transfers.

Each item in C<@transfers> is a hash reference compatible suitable for
L</transfer_record>. The only exception is that parameter C<parent> can
be set to reference elements in C<@transfers> that occur I<before> the
specific transfer to be recorded, indicating the parent transfer index
as a string between brackets.

In the following example, we ask the creation of three transfers, the
first one being the parent of the following two. As you can see, the
C<parent> key in the child transfers is a string with a C<0> in
brackets; the C<0> indicates the index of the first transfer in the
provided list (i.e. the C<prova (main)> transfer at the beginning).

   @transfers = $ak->multi_transfers_record(
      {
         src    => 1,
         dst    => 2,
         title  => 'prova (main)',
         amount => 10000,
      },
      {
         src    => 2,
         dst    => 3,
         title  => 'prova (first)',
         amount => 7000,
         parent => '[0]',
      },
      {
         src    => 2,
         dst    => 4,
         title  => 'prova (second)',
         amount => 3000,
         parent => '[0]',
      },
   );

=head2 B<< quota_groups >>

   my @quota_types      = $ak->quota_groups();
   my $quota_types_aref = $ak->quota_groups();

get all pre-defined quota groups, i.e. pre-defined splitting into
(weighted) quotas.

Depending on calling context, you will either get a list of quotas back,
or a reference to an array containing the quotas.

There are two types of quota groups: I<plain> and I<finance> (see
L</Quotas> for details).

Each quota group returned is a hash reference with at least the
following keys:

=over

=item C<id>

identifier of the quota group, useful for retrieving it later. For
I<plain> quota groups, it is the same as the C<name> below; otherwise,
it represents the group of sub-quotas associated to the specific
C<name>;

=item C<name>

name of the quota group, used for retrieving it. For I<plain> quota
groups, this is the same as C<id>;

=item C<type>

this is a string that can be either C<plain> or C<finance>.

=back

For I<finance> quota groups, the following additional keys are
available:

=over

=item C<maxs>

the maximum value for C<sequence_number>;

=item C<mins>

the minimum value for C<sequence_number>;

=item C<sequence_number>

the next quota sub-group identifier.

=back

=head2 B<< transfer_and_contribution_split >>

   my @transfers = $ak->transfer_and_contribution_split(
      $transfer, $split);
   my $transfers = $ak->transfer_and_contribution_split(
      $transfer, $split);

perform a transfer and its split into contributions in one single
transaction. C<$transfer> is a hash reference compatible with
L</transfer_record>; C<$split> is a split definition compatible with
L</contribution_split> (you can of course omit the transfer in this
case, as it will be overridden by the one created from C<$transfer>).

Returns the list of transfers created, or a reference to an array with
the list in scalar context.

=head2 B<< transfer_and_distribution_split >>

   my @transfers = $ak->transfer_and_distribution_split(
      $transfer, $split);
   my $transfers = $ak->transfer_and_distribution_split(
      $transfer, $split);

perform a transfer and its split into distributions in one single
transaction. C<$transfer> is a hash reference compatible with
L</transfer_record>; C<$split> is a split definition compatible with
L</distribution_split> (you can of course omit the transfer in this
case, as it will be overridden by the one created from C<$transfer>).

Returns the list of transfers created, or a reference to an array with
the list in scalar context.

=head2 B<< transfer_delete >>

   $ak->transfer_delete($transfer);

wrapper around L<Accounting::Kitty::Result::Transfer/mark_delete>, where
C<$trasfer> is passed through L</fetch> to get to a real transfer
object. Does not return anything.

=head2 B<< transfer_record >>

   my $transfer = $ak->transfer_record(\%def);

record a new transfer and get it back, I<DWIM>my.

The input hash reference C<\%def> has the following keys:

=over

=item C<amount>

the amount of the transaction;

=item C<date>

the transaction date (and time), parsed via
L<DateTime::Format::ISO8601/parse_datetime>. Defaults to
L<DateTime/now>;

=item C<description>

a string with the description of the transaction, optional (defaults to
the empty string);

=item C<dst>

the destination account, pass a C<$query> compatible with L</fetch>;

=item C<parent>

the parent of the transaction, in case this is a split of an existing
transaction. It can be either the parent's identifier, or another
transaction object;

=item C<src>

the source account, pass a C<$query> compatible with L</fetch>;

=item C<title>

a string with the title of the transaction, optional (defaults to the
empty string).

=back

If the C<amount> is negative, C<dst> and C<src> are swapped and the
transfer is recorded with a positive amount (i.e. as the opposite of the
provided C<amount>).
